PROBLEM STATEMENT
Fox Ciel has a simple undirected graph with n vertices.
The vertices are numbered 0 through n-1.
The graph is connected.
You are given a vector <string> G containing the adjacency matrix of the graph.
More precisely, for each i and j, G[i][j] is 'Y' if there is an edge between vertices i and j and it is 'N' if there is no such edge.


Ciel then implemented a depth-first search:  



p = []

dfs(current) := 
	p.append(current)
	Let adjs[] = list of vertices that are adjacent to current.
	random_shuffle(adjs)
	for v in adjs:
		if v is not in p:
			dfs(v)

Let start = random(0, n-1)   # a random number between 0 and n-1, inclusive
dfs(start)
output(p)



Clearly, the output of this algorithm is always a permutation of the numbers from 0 to n-1.
However, as the algorithm uses randomness, there may be multiple possible outputs.
Please compute and return the number of different permutations the algorithm may return.

DEFINITION
Class:DFSCount
Method:count
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:long long
Method signature:long long count(vector <string> G)


CONSTRAINTS
-n will be between 1 and 14, inclusive.
-G will contain exactly n elements.
-Each element in G will contain exactly n characters.
-Each character in G will be 'N' or 'Y'.
-For any valid i, G[i][i] = 'N'.
-For any valid i and j, G[i][j] = G[j][i].
-The graph described by G will be connected.


EXAMPLES

0)
{"NYY",
 "YNY",
 "YYN"}

Returns: 6

G describes a complete graph with 3 vertices. 
There are 3! = 6 permutations of vertices, and we can easily verify that each of these permutations can appear as the output of Ciel's algorithm.

1)
{"NYNN",
 "YNYN",
 "NYNY",
 "NNYN"}


Returns: 6

This time the graph is a line: 0 - 1 - 2 - 3.
These are the possible outputs:

0,1,2,3
1,0,2,3
1,2,3,0
2,1,0,3
2,3,1,0
3,2,1,0


2)
{"NYYY",
 "YNYY",
 "YYNN",
 "YYNN"}


Returns: 16

This graph looks as follows:

  2
 / \
0---1
 \ /
  3

There are 16 possible permutations:

0,1,2,3
0,1,3,2
0,2,1,3
0,3,1,2
1,0,2,3
1,0,3,2
1,2,0,3
1,3,0,2
2,0,1,3
2,0,3,1
2,1,0,3
2,1,3,0
3,0,1,2
3,0,2,1
3,1,0,2
3,1,2,0


3)
{"NYYYYYYYYYYYYY",
 "YNYYYYYYYYYYYY",
 "YYNYYYYYYYYYYY",
 "YYYNYYYYYYYYYY",
 "YYYYNYYYYYYYYY",
 "YYYYYNYYYYYYYY",
 "YYYYYYNYYYYYYY",
 "YYYYYYYNYYYYYY",
 "YYYYYYYYNYYYYY",
 "YYYYYYYYYNYYYY",
 "YYYYYYYYYYNYYY",
 "YYYYYYYYYYYNYY",
 "YYYYYYYYYYYYNY",
 "YYYYYYYYYYYYYN"}

Returns: 87178291200

The answer is 14!

4)
{"N"}

Returns: 1
